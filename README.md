# 🎬 Test Project — Movie App

Due to unforeseen circumstances, I wasn’t able to finish the project completely.  
However, I focused on laying a **solid architectural foundation** and demonstrating my skills with the technologies I used.

This project was built using **MVVM**, **Combine**, and a mix of **UIKit (Storyboard + programmatic)** and **SwiftUI**, showing my ability to combine both UI frameworks effectively.

If you’re interested in seeing the project completed, please reach out to me on **Telegram — t.me/pavlo_bezkorovainyi**.  
I’d be happy to finish it in my free time.

Thank you very much for your time and understanding! 🙏
